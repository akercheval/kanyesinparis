## Group 6, Status Report 3
This past week we began implementing gameplay by creating destinations for 
Kanye to drive too.  Locations are represented as areas of the canvas.  When 
Kanye arrives, the page will redirect to the new pages (louvre.html, 
eiffel.html, and moulinrouge.html) containing Ye-related trivia; correct 
answers return the player to the game page and incorrect answers show losing 
messages and prompt user to play again.

Next we will use session data and persistent data storage to implement the
'scavanger-hunt' aspect of gameplay and a leaderboard.  We missed the mark
on aesthetic development, although we did learn how to display and update
text on the canvas for countdown and speedometer.
