<p> Wake up, Mr. West! Kim K., the love of your life, has been robbed at gunpoint in a Parisian hotel and it's your job to solve the crime! </p>

<p>
    Drive from point to point in the City of Love, solving the Crime of the Century, before your 60 seconds runs out!
    But remember, Drive Slow, Homie! Parisian detectives are no good, but their traffic cops are the best around.
    If you get arrested for going over 5 km/h, you lose time!
</p>

<p>
    Use the arrow keys to speed up, slow down and change direction.
    First stop: the Eiffel Tower!
</p>
<p>
    Bonne chance, Monsieur Ouest!
