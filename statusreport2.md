## Group 6, Status Report 2
This week, we continued working on a variety of details in our game. We fixed the
CORS error that was holding us up for confirming whether Kanye is on a road,
thanks to your help on Piazza, Ming!
We also added various images, html files, and css files for stops that Kanye
will make on his journey around Paris, where he'll receive clues as to where to
find Kim.

In the future, we're going to work on making the game come together visually, that
is, put all the data we have above the board right now into the board, we'll begin
creating some legitimate gameplay, and we'll start working on reporting player
stats at the end of the game and keeping track of high scores with client-side
data persistence.
