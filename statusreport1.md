Group 6 Status Report 1

This week our team made a semi-functional game board where Kanye can drive around. The speed is capped and there is a time limit. There is also a purple box that sends a pop-up notification when Kanye drives into it (this feature will be the base of all the destinations on the game board).

The biggest challenge we faced was an unresolved CORS bug trying to accsess the color of the canvas beneath Kanye. This will be used to limit Kanye to only drive on roads. 

Next week our goal is to further develop the style of our gameboard so the speed is presented as a spedometer, solve the CORS bug to implement road behavior and begin introducing destinations on game board.
